					<p >Don't know much about sketching, but I love my scribbles and believe me, painting,
						sketching etc can be really therapeutic and helps to fight stress and don't just take
						take my word for it, try yourself.</p><p>One tip, no matter how bad it looks in the start just
						keep going on, there are many perpectives to judge an art thats why no painting can be bad
					  even a blank canvas and you know what sometimes it brings out your childhood impressions of the world and you might
						get lost in nostalgia.</p><p>Who knows that there might be a great artist suppressed within you because of
						those wrong decisions you took back then, and its never too late to find that out. I am a staunch believer
						of the concept that <em><q> Art shapes the future
						</q></em> as it inspires science &amp; theory to look around for a different perspective, differentiates you from a
						machine or artificial conscience, sometimes keeps you loaded with motivation to function beyond your
						expectations, might even help you find your passsion in life. Oh I moved so much away from the topic, here
					check out the article below.</p><p>Moreover sketching, drawing and stuffs like that are more pragmatic than we think,
						we need a lot of creative &amp; design workforce to help fuel this digital art revolution going on like in
						designing VR world, interactive books novels magazines, games and so
					much more in various entertainment sectors. There are so many tools available
					 that you wont need to know any technical details, just start your pure designing.</p>

						style="width:300px; max-height:auto;"></a>
					<p>This sketches are edited a bit because why not if you can, just trying to rationalize
						my imperfections by filters and textures.Also to compress this images for better
						loading time had to compromise with image quality a lot. I need to learn some techniques
						 for image compressions and using CDNs for this media stuffs, hopefully I ll do it soon.
					</p>
					<div class="clr"></div>
					<h3>13 Nov, 2017</h3>
					<hr/>
					<p>Feeling awesome! the loading time for this website has improved significantly by using
					CDN(content delivery network) for so many images at imgur. Its so awesome definately check them out.
				  Also learned a great deal on animations and graphic design using canvas &amp; SVG in HTML5,
					check out my projects section for more details.</p>
					<a href="./Experiment/canvastest/index.html" target="_blank">
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zx8OPvB.png" alt="web template" width="300px" height="auto"/></a>
					<p>Also defined a ton of code snippets for faster coding in my precious
						editor atom, it saves a hell lot of time from doing repetetive tasks.
						God bless the Github team for their awesome opensource gem atom.</p>
					<p>Quora, Medium &amp; Twitter are turning out to be awesome sources of
						informations these days, everytime I go through them theres always fresh
						and highly informative articles available, most of the tools and hacks info
						i got to know from these places itself.</p>

					<hr/>
					<a href="./index.html"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FBkSLJQ.png"
						alt="letter Dynamic animation" style="width:300px;"></a>
					<p>Just added a new cool animation on the homepage panel, took a lot
						to figure that out, many thanks to <a href="http://daverupert.com" target="_blank">
						Dave Rupert</a> for providing the function for dynamic lettering(
						converting to &lt;span&gt; objects for each letter) of text elements.
						Learned a lot through that function, and got many new ideas too.
						There is so much to learn still, its weird when you dont know about
						something then fiddling with it seems so simple and unrestricting but when
						u start going into practical depths then you realize layer after layer
					 of complexities, Alas! someday not so far away maybe I ll figure out.</p>
					<p>The Night mode button has still some issues but no time right now as
						I have to start working on the <abbr title="mongoDB Express.js Angular
						Node.js">MEAN</abbr> stack, and figure out this mongoDB
						and node.js which looks like promising technologies for 2018. As recently
						heard from a friend whos a Backend dev that their company is shifting
						from PHP to node.js
					</p>

						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WnjmKO7.png" alt="Responsive design" style="width:300px;"></a>
					<p>It took me like a complete 12 hrs stretch to figure out the new responsive
						design for this webpage but its finally here. But Oh god!, going through
						old CSS files is a massive headache. I must start using Sass to help
						me out or atleast reduce the redundant CSS burdens and the perfect
						hierarchy model from Sass for CSS will definately help in re-designing
						for any future references.
					</p>
					<p>Now here's the deal if you wanna see the responsive design kick in
						just do the following for your device&minus;
					<ul>
						<li><strong>For Laptop</strong> just keep reducing the width of your browser window to like its one-third
						or 450px to be exact. And voilla! theres the new layout</li>
						<li><strong>For Mobile</strong> to see the responsive design kick in just tilt your phone in
						landscape mode and make sure your auto-rotate option is on.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

						alt="NeetishRaj Favicon" style="width:300px;"></a>
					<p>How is my Icon for this website, that you can see in the tab at the top of this window. Should
						have done this earlier but thought that It would be too tough but turns
						 out making Favicons is so easy you just need a 16x16 or 32x32 size image
					  file saved with .ico extension and save it to your main server directory
						 in the where your index file is.</p>
					<p>But there are complications involved if you want it to be perfect, because
						you ll need various formats of your icon for various platforms i.e apple, windows,
					  android etc. They have their own styling for icons, so we ll need to display
						platform specific images. Also we need to have an SVG format too, in case
						the image need to scale without pixelleting and also a small memory-size
						alternative for your icon Image as Fallback in case main one does'nt load
						due to high bandwidth.</p>
					<p>You can check out my favicon folder
						<a href="https://github.com/NeetishRaj/NeetishRaj.github.io/tree/master/favicons">here</a>.
						Although you dont need to do this because there might be only slight
						difference mainly in background fill color, margin, padding, border-radius
						or any image filters. But if wanna preserve the actual image quality
						in all platforms then it is mandatory to have all backups. If you want
						your own cross platform favicon sets then its very easy if you use
						any online generators like this <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net">
						Favicon Generator</a> that comes very handy and Free of cost also can tweak
						it to your desires platform-wise.</p>
						<h3>Dec 23, 2017</h3>
						<hr/>
					<p>Exacly a month later, its been a lot going lately, studying new
						things getting stuck in projects for days, so I have been trying to
						get hold on J2EE platform for developing a full fledged web app and
						it looks like its gonna be atleast months before I am worth something
						in that platform.</p>
					<p>By the way check out the two SPA projects HTML color study and CSS3
						filters based Image editor, I made both these codes to help beginners
					 	learn complicated stuffs easily, that is exactly seeing how they works
						with output responses. They are cool be sure to check them out in my
						Projects page</p>
