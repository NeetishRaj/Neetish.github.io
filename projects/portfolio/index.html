            <h1>Image Editor SPA</h1>
            <p>An online tool for editing images and CSS3 code generation 
              of every possible styles on images. This 
              tool was developed to help budding web designers in my online 
              community to understand CSS based image modification tactics.
              In recent years, images are gaining prominence in the front facade
               of websites, hence its logical to
              understand all the complexities involved while working with images.

            <h1>HTML Color study</h1>
            <p>While designing websites its inevitable to get stuck in picking 
              color combinations. There are many helpful tools available
              for free, my favourite being Adobe Color
              wheel but I needed a light weight version designed to meet my needs.
              In the end this project turned out to be a learning tool to study
              colors in HTML like RGB, HSL, Named colors.

            <h2>Web designing</h2>
            <p>As evident from few projects shown above I am capable of designing
              responsive layouts supporting different screen sizes & aspect ratios
              from scratch with backward browser compatibility.
              CSS frameworks brings consistency and speeds up the designing process 
              and infact this portfolio page itself is made using few bootstrap 
              classes. I have worked with CSS precompilers like SASS, graphic 
              design with SVG and animations using HTML5 Canvas. I am also capable
              of all sorts of native DOM-BOM manipulations and Event handling using
              Javascript or jQuery. My website is also available as a PWA using
              service workers therefore providing native app like experience in
              smartphones. Recently I have been fiddling with Native web components
              to come up with my own light weight library.

            <h2> Front end development</h2>
            <p>I developed strong background in Front-end development due to two
              years of exposure in a large React codebase with beautiful architecture.
               I spearheaded React
              initiatives across multiple teams comprising of hundred developers.
              My presentations included topics like <b>"TDD with React", "Understanding
              scope of Unit tests and Integration tests", "Code review guidelines"</b>.
              I can architect a complete process for a new project starting from design,
              development and testing in local environment through integration,
              staging till deployment in production
              environment. Having a strong background in Nodejs gave me
              an advantage over others when working with frameworks like React
              or Angular. I consider end to end debugging skills to be my
              strongest suit in front end development.

      <p>Contrary to a programmer, designer has a tough job of incorporating best
        User experience while complying with style guidelines from Product engineering.
        I am a strong proponent of separate UI/UX design team. As per my 
        experience switching between design and development in a big project is
        often counterproductive in the long run but it doesn't mean that developers
        can shy away from design decisions. Design elements like color-combinations,
        spacing, animations must be consistent through out the application and requires
        special coordination when multiple teams are working on same application suite.
        <b>A comprehensive style guide is indispensable.</b>

            <p>I am a street smart Software engineer with a Bachelors degree in

              India and working with a US client who is a market leader in GRC

            <h2>Server side development</h2>
            <p>Developers having expertise in both frontend and backend development
              are a rare find. Although their numbers are growing due to shift towards
              Microservice architecture where Application is broken down so that small
              teams or even single person can take ownership of a service module,
              therefore gaining exposure to both sides.

            <h2> Back-end Programming</h2>
            <p>I started strong with Javascript as my primary language and picked up Java basics along the way whenever
              required. With the popularity of Nodejs growing, also picked up basics of file manipulation, Web server,
              routing , express and templating. Not my strong suit yet, since the learning process is currently going
              need per basis for my projects. Also good background with MySQL and Oracle's 11g DBMS. But so much looking
              forward to work with the popular MEAN stack because of my available skillsets with javascript and related
              frameworks. Also exploring options with simple SQLlite, as currently involved in developing an android app
              for a friend.</p>

      <p>Server side development can be a daunting task for people coming from
        frontend background. Working on Infrastructure, Databases and Security. It's imperative that a backend professional understands prominent
        web protocols like HTTP, FTP and application's protocol stack. A full stack
        developer should be able to come up with the Architecture diagram.
