        <!-- <h2>Snow</h2> -->

        <p>Its the first picture in my mind</p>
        <p>I used to hv notebooks with beautiful snow covered houses</p>
        <p>And I have never seen snow, But someday</p>
        <p>First thing I will do is</p>
        <p>Make super dense snowballs</p>
        <p>And throw at complete stranger</p>
        <p>Jump from rooftops naked over snow filled lawn</p>
        <p>Make yellow snow in front of neighbour door and not get caught</p>
        <p>Cuddle inside heavy blanket all day, someday with someone</p>

      <div class="story food">
        <!-- <h2>Food</h2> -->
        <p>Its almost been 10 years since I started living away from home</p>
        <p>I survived on roadside junk food for days with only once food poisoning</p>
        <p>Even learned to cook few boring dishes, more like everthing is stew and soup</p>
        <p>In the starting years it was not a big deal</p>
        <p>But now whenever my ground floor family cooks something delicious</p>
        <p>The scent of the tasty food finds its way to my nose, even when all windows are closed</p>
        <p>Cooking is not that easy, it takes years to master</p>
        <p>For all my life I miss my mom the most on these days</p>
      </div>
      <div class="story cards">
        <p>Greeting cards will never get old</p>
        <p>No matter how beautiful a digital card is or the animation</p>
        <p>I remember cycling 2 miles when I was 8 or 9 years old</p>
        <p>That too first time on busy roads</p>
        <p>To give a New year card to my best friend</p>
        <p>And also to show him my new cycle</p>
        <p>I love reading greeting cards meant for others, without them knowing of course</p>
        <p>Anybody seen 500 days of summer, it just clicked, no reason</p>
        <p>My best card was a rose-fragrance New years card from a girl in school</p>
        <p>But the sad thing was she gave it to other guys too</p>
      </div>
      <div class="story nowork">
        <p>Holiday means holiday for real this week</p>
        <p>Other holidays, people will still bug you but not in this</p>
        <p>I really respect people still working away from families during this week</p>
        <p>My religion is different, christmas is not celebrated at my house with X-mas tree</p>
        <p>But dad brings tons of sweets and mom cooks awesome things</p>
        <p>Dad will spend most of the time with friends</p>
        <p>And we kids got our awesome non stop movie &amp; video game time</p>
        <p>And I could relate myself with kids in english movies with christmas</p>
        <p>Painful thing for me in christmas holidays was</p>
        <p>Seeing other kids getting awesome toys and gifts in TV</p>
        <p>And dad saying you will get yours in birthday, wait 1 month</p>
      </div>
      <div class="story adult">
        <p>Holiday definition changed when I grew up a little</p>

      <div class="story end">
        <p>Wishing you Merry Christmas</p>
        <p>And a happy new year</p>
